# **Game Mathematics**

A C++ workspace focused on the mathematics and physics that drive game logic.

This repository exists to implement how formulas, vectors, angles, and physical principles turn into movement, interaction, and simulation.

Rather than treating math as abstract theory, this project treats it as something that is written, executed, and tested in code.  
Everything here is built around using mathematics to make things move, rotate, collide, and respond.

## **What this repository is**

This project focuses on the math that actually makes games work:

- Vectors and movement
- Dot and cross products
- Angles, direction, and orientation
- Physics-style motion (velocity, acceleration, gravity)
- Interpolation and smoothing
- Matrices and transformations (translation, rotation, scale)
- Coordinate systems
- Collision and spatial tests
- Frustum culling
- Painter Algorithm, MergeSort

The goal is not to be abstract or academic — the goal is to show how these ideas behave when turned into logic and systems.

## **What this repository is for**

This repo is meant to serve as:

- A technical workspace for developing and testing game-math concepts
- A reference for how gameplay-driven calculations are implemented
- A place to translate mathematical theory into practical game-ready code

## **Status**

This repository exists to make those invisible decisions visible.

It is not a finished product.  
It is not a general-purpose math library.

It is a **working notebook** for understanding how games use mathematics.

---

## **Based On**

This repository is based on and inspired by the work found in:

https://github.com/BSVino/MathForGameDevelopers/tree/frustum-culling

This project focuses on rebuilding and experimenting with those ideas through hands-on C++ implementation.
